# Fake Review Detection on Amazon SageMaker
### Revision: 1

This project implements a machine learning solution for detecting fake reviews using Amazon SageMaker. The implementation uses transformer-based models to classify reviews as either genuine or fake.

```

## Getting Started

1. Launch a SageMaker JupyterLab instance
2. Clone this repository
3. Open the `notebooks/fake_review_detection_poc.ipynb` notebook
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model

## Proof of Concept

The PoC notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing review data
- Fine-tuning a pretrained transformer model
- Evaluating model performance
- Testing with sample reviews

## Version Tracking

This repository includes a version tracking system to help manage changes:

- Each file has a revision number displayed at the top
- Use `./update_revision.sh <file_path> [commit_message]` to update a file's revision
- View revision history with `python version_tracker.py log`
- Check current revision status with `python version_tracker.py status`

## Next Steps

- Expand to multi-lingual capabilities
- Use larger and more diverse datasets
- Implement more sophisticated features
- Deploy as a SageMaker endpoint

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- SageMaker SDK
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
